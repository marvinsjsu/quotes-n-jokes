## Project Description

Being a big fan of the show, Ted Lasso, I built this page to re-live some
of its many funny moments. It's built with plain JavaScript to manipulate
the DOM and uses the [MediaDevices API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices) and [Voice RSS](https://www.voicerss.org/) for text-to-speech.  The quotes
come from [Ted Lasso Quotes API](https://tedlassoquotes.com/).
